## This is my Project: Pet Grooming Management,17/10/2024
## Description
This code demonstrates a web application for managing pet grooming information. It retrieves pet data grouped by groomer, allows adding new pets, and provides functionalities for deleting, editing, and viewing pet details. Additionally, the code includes features for managing grooming tips, enabling users to add, edit, and delete tips.

## Key Features:

* Fetches pet data from a server (simulated with https://phase1-project-emma.onrender.com//pets).
* Groups pets by groomer and displays them in separate sections.
* Enables adding new pets with details like owner, breed, grooming status, etc.
* Provides options for deleting, editing, and viewing pet details.
* Manages grooming tips through a dedicated form.
* Allows users to add, edit, and delete grooming tips.
* Displays grooming tips in a grid layout (configurable with column size).

## Technical Notes:

*The code utilizes JavaScript with DOM manipulation and event handling.
It interacts with a server-side API (https://phase1-project-emma.onrender.com//pets and https://phase1-project-emma.onrender.com//groomingTips) for fetching, adding, updating, and deleting data.

*Bootstrap classes are used for styling the user interface.
Getting Started:

Ensure you have a server running that provides the necessary API endpoints.
Copy the code into your project directory.
Adjust the base URL ('https://phase1-project-emma.onrender.com/pets') if your server endpoint differs.
Open the HTML file (index.html) in a web browser to interact with the application.

## Dependencies:

* Bootstrap (for styling)
* jQuery (for DOM manipulation)
